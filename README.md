I decided to start writing again in October 2019. My first post was a port from old post on AlphaGo that I had written in Medium. I decided to use my own site, generated using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) because I didn't like Medium's paywall.
